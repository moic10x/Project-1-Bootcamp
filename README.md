<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our aim for this was project was to explore the following questions:
    
* How do different sectors of the economy vary in their treatment of employees, specifically vis a vis parental leave?
    
* Is there any relationship between the amount of paternity and maternity leave that companies give their employees?
    
* Is there a relationship between employee benefits and the wages they receive?

<!-- FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS -->
## Follow Up

Help answer our follow up questions:

* Does the size of a company have any bearing on parental leave allowed?

* Our data is sourced from US based companies or their US branchesâ€¦ how does it compare to other countries?

* Analyzing the effects of US state parental leave laws on companies' productivity and hiring policies

* Obtaining data from a country-wide survey with respect to how many employees who do have parental leave benefits actually fully use those  benefits. Why and why not?

* Have there been lawsuits related to companies that chose to avoid hiring young women solely based on the high likelihood of parental leave benefits use?
